    "## Coding Session 1 - Oct 26th, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is an important part of being a 21st century STEM professional, and can be a great asset to have in applying for research. There’s a lot of stigma around CS, and often students assume that learning to code will be overwhelming and inaccessible. This is not true! Today we will be going over a very gentle introduction to Python, a popular programming language that was designed to be both easily readable and intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Python\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is download Python. This can be done a few different ways, but the simplest is through Anaconda. Using this link, https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual, select your machine and operating system. Download Anaconda and go through the setup/installation wizard. After completing these steps, you should be able to use the Anaconda Navigator to open a jupyter notebook. Jupyter is a “web-based, interactive computing environment” and is a great place to learn to code. You can organize your code into cells and run each cell by pressing ```Shift + Enter```.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we also need a quick definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Syntax** in coding is the set of rules imposed by the programming language that make the computer understand the code you've written (in an analogous way to what punctuation is to day-to-day     language). As implied these vary based on the language that you are using: a semicolon suppresses output in MATLAB, while it is required to end lines of code in Java or C++. Learning a programming language means learning its syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is so widespread as a language because its syntax is very easy to read and learn (as you will see!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types and Variable Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon you will start programming notice that most of it deals with variables that store information, usually as a type of **data** such as numbers, a word, or truth values. These different types of data are called **data types** and have individual names:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ``int``: this is an integer number, ex: 5, 7, -238\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ``float``: this is a decimal number, ex: 12.3, -98.07\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ``boolean``: this is a truth value and can either be assigned \"True\" or \"False\"\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ``str``: this is a \"string\" of characters and is stored in quotations, ex: \"I love physics\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know about data types, we can try creating a variable and giving it something to store. To assign a variable a data type in Python, simply write a variable name and the value you'd like it to store separated by an equal sign:\n",
